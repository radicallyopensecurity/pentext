                        <p>Sitting Duck B.V. (“Sitting Duck”) has assigned the task of performing a
                                Penetration Test of the FishInABarrel Web Application to Radically
                                Open Security BV (hereafter “ROS”). Sitting Duck has made this
                                request to better evaluate the security of the application and to
                                identify application level vulnerabilities in order to see whether
                                the FishInABarrel Web Application is ready, security-wise, for
                                production deployment.</p>
                        <p>This report contains our findings as well as detailed explanations of
                                exactly how ROS performed the penetration test.</p>

                        <generate_targets/>
                        <p>The penetration test was carried out from a black box perspective: no
                                information regarding the system(s) tested was provided by Sitting
                                Duck or FishInABarrel, although FishInABarrel did provide ROS with
                                two test user accounts.</p>

                        <p>During this pentest, we found quite a number of different security
                                problems – Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, both stored
                                and reflected, Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities,
                                information disclosures (multiple instances), and lack of brute
                                force protection.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>In the course of this penetration test, we have demonstrated that the
                        FishInABarrel Web Application faces a range of security issues which makes
                        it vulnerable to a number of different attacks. Vulnerabilities found
                        included: cross-site scripting (both stored and reflected), cross-site
                        request forgery, information disclosure and lack of brute force
                        protection.</p>
                <p>Our conclusion is that there are a number of things that FishInABarrel BV has to
                        fix before Sitting Duck should use their software. A number of the security
                        issues highlighted in this report have fairly simple solutions, but these
                        should nevertheless be fixed before use of the FishInABarrel Web App
                        continues.</p>
                <p>We finally want to emphasize that security is a process – and this penetration
                        test is just a one-time snapshot. Security posture must be continuously
                        evaluated and improved. Regular audits and ongoing improvements are
                        essential in order to maintain control of your corporate information
                        security. We hope that this pentest report (and the detailed explanations of
                        our findings) will contribute meaningfully towards that end. Don't hesitate
                        to let us know if you have any further questions or need further
                        clarification of anything in this report.</p>
