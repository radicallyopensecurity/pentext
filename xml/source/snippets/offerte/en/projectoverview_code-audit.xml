    <p>
        <company_short/> will perform a <company_svc_long/> of the source code files described below
        for <client_short/>. The code audit is intended to gain insight into the security of the
        source code. To do so, <company_short/> will analyze the code, attempt to find
        vulnerabilities, and gain further access and elevated privileges by exploiting any
        vulnerabilities found. </p>

    <p>
        <company_short/> will test the following code (the “<b>Targets</b>”): </p>

    <generate_targets/>

    <p>
        <company_short/> will test for the presence of the most common vulnerabilities using a
        combination of publicly available (static, dynamic and concolic) analytic tools, fuzzing and
        code reading. <company_short/> will need <p_persondays/> persondays for this code audit. </p>

    <!--p>It is possible that in the course of the penetration
  testing, <company_short/> might hinder the operations of the Targets or
  cause damage to the Targets. <client_short/> gives permission for this, to
  the extent that <company_short/> does not act negligently or
  recklessly. <client_short/> also warrants it has the authority to give such
  permission.</p-->

    <!--p>It is important to understand the limits of
  <company_short/>'s services. <company_short/> does not (and cannot)
  give guarantees that something is secure. <company_short/> instead has
  an obligation to make reasonable efforts (in Dutch:
  “<i>inspanningsverplichting</i>”) to perform the agreed services.</p-->
