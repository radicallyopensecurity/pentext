  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>We discovered <finding_count/>-severity issues during this penetration test.</p>

  <p><todo desc="Add some paragraphs describing in high level the impact of these findings on the organization, priorities in fixing them"/></p>

  <p>We recommend fixing all of the issues found and then performing a retest in order to ensure
    that mitigations are effective and that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced. </p>
  <p> Finally, we want to emphasize that security is a process – this penetration test is just a
    one-time snapshot. Security posture must be continuously evaluated and improved. Regular audits
    and ongoing improvements are essential in order to maintain control of your corporate
    information security. We hope that this pentest report (and the detailed explanations of our
    findings) will contribute meaningfully towards that end. </p>
  <p> Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any further questions, or need further
    clarification on anything in this report. </p>
