  <title>Social Engineering: Phishing</title>
  <p><company_short/>
    will engage in social-engineering-based attacks. As requested,
    the focus will be on sending phishing emails to test how vulnerable
    the selected targets are to this approach.
  </p>
  <p>For phishing to be successful it is important that
    <company_short/>
    has detailed information on the targets. Providing
    <company_short/>
    with a list of target names, roles, email addresses, departments, and
    any other useful information, in advance will save significant research
    time.
  </p>
  <p>The phishing process includes these stages:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Research target information</li>
      <li>Group related targets</li>
      <li>Create pretexts suitable for one or more groups</li>
      <li>Build/adapt tools and services to implement the attack</li>
      <li>Send mailings to the groups</li>
      <li>Gather &amp; analyze results</li>
      <li>Report conclusions</li>
    </ul>
</p>
  <p>First, targets are divided into groups, dependent upon their
    departments, roles and interests. Next, content that might appeal to
    each group is created or adapted into appropriate phishing pretexts. The
    content may be new, using fictional company names, or based on existing
    company information and content if pretexts need to be very realistic.
    The mailings are usually sent using existing chat operated tools (and
    <client_short/> may observe the process if interested), or alternatively
    <company_short/>
    may create something new, if the situation calls for it.
  </p>
  <p>To record which targets click message links, <company_short/>
    uses click-tracking redirects, in the same way most email newsletters
    do. When a target clicks on a link in a phishing mail, their email
    address, IP address, and the name of the mailing is sent to us and
    logged. Once a victim's click has been recorded, he/she is removed from
    the target list as a single successful click is per target is sufficient
    for the purposes of these benign attacks. Clicks may happen seconds,
    days or weeks after sending, so it's important to wait for results to
    accumulate. When sufficient mailings have been sent, and enough data has
    (hopefully) been received, the logged results are analyzed and presented
    in the final report.
